# WhatsApp Web Frontend
![Previu](https://i.ibb.co/GsK2GPx/whatsapp-clone.jpg)

Welcome to the **WhatsApp Web Frontend** project! This is a frontend clone of WhatsApp, created using **React** and **Vite.js**. The goal of this project is to learn and collaborate with a group of friends by implementing a modern, user-friendly interface with key features from WhatsApp.

## üåü Features

- **Authentication**: Login with email and password.
- **OTP Verification**: Secure your account using OTP (One Time Password) for additional verification.
- **Profile Creation**: Create a user profile with a photo.
- **Messaging**: Send messages with emojis, view statuses, and manage your chats.
- **Calls & Settings**: Access sections for calls and app settings, just like WhatsApp.

## üé® Design and Libraries

We've put a lot of effort into creating a clean and pleasant design. The app is fully componentized for easy maintenance and scalability. Here are some key libraries used in the project:

- **@emoji-mart/react** & **emoji-mart**: For emoji support in messages.
- **@mui/material**: Material UI components for a responsive and sleek design.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
